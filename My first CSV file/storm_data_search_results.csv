The tornado started west of town initially and moved slowly to the east, eventually crossing Highway 83. As the tornado crossed the highway, it started to impact structures on the west side of Selden, and eventually moving across the town. In town, damage was widespread and quiet concentrated. At one point, the tornado reached a width of one half mile wide. Damage consisted of thousands of broken tree limbs, hundreds of uprooted and snapped trees, shingles off and pieces of roofing removed from residences and buildings, many farm outbuildings either missing roofing material, walls damaged, and/or the building completely collapsed and removed from its foundation, windows broken out of houses, buildings, and vehicles, snapped power poles, overturned irrigation pivots, overturned semis and rail cars, and several grain silos blown over.||The tornado then proceeded to the east, exiting town and heading towards the Highway 83 and Highway 383 split. There were a few more irrigation pivots overturned, as well as power poles snapped. The tornado appeared to dissipate as it neared the Highway 83 and Highway 383 split due to a lack of any visible damage at that intersection.||The challenge with this survey was there were multiple vortices causing damage. Therefore, there were a few areas of more concentrated high-end EF-1 damage with broad/widespread EF-0 to EF-1 damage.||There was one minor injury with this event. The town tornado sirens were not functioning as a result of a power outage. Therefore, fire fighters jumped into their vehicles to drive through town to warn people of the coming tornado. Powerlines fell upon one of the trucks, striking a fire fighter in the back of the neck.
